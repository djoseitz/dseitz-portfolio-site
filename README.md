# David Seitz Portfolio

## Design Process

I used Bootstrap for this portfolio website, as I knew that my portfolio will likely grow and change rapidly in a year, I wanted styling that could change quickly and responsively to new content inserted.

## Hosted on Heroku

Hosted on Heroku, which has been my preferred free hosting platform, due to unreliability from Netlify.
