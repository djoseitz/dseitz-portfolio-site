# David Seitz Portfolio

## Design Process

As this was initially intended as a simple test of skills, I built this website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have since switched to a Bootstrap-based site, which is more flexible.

## Hosted on Heroku

Hosted on Heroku, due to issues with Netlify at time of creation. Once these had been resolved, I had re-built this portfolio using a Bootstrap base.
